drm: sun4i: Add support for the HDMI controller

Hi,

Here is an attempt at getting the HDMI controller running.

This HDMI controller is found on a number of old Allwinner SoCs (A10, A10s,
A20, A31).

This driver only supports for now the A10s because it was an easy target,
being very close to the A13 that is already supported by our DRM driver.

There's nothing out of the extraordinary there, except maybe the clock
setup. All the internal clocks (TMDS, DDC) have been modeled using the
common clock framework, the TMDS clock being the parent of the DDC one.

While this might sound overkill, other SoC have a different, external
source for the DDC clock, which will be easier to support through the clock
framework.

It's still a bit rough around the edges, as it doesn't work for all the
modes. This will need to be fixed before being merged obviously.

Let me know what you think!
Maxime
