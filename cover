drm: Split out the formats API and move it to a common place

Hi,

DRM comes with an extensive format support to retrieve the various
parameters associated with a given format (such as the subsampling, or the
bits per pixel), as well as some helpers and utilities to ease the driver
development.

v4l2, on the other side, doesn't provide such facilities, leaving each
driver reimplement a subset of the formats parameters for the one supported
by that particular driver. This leads to a lot of duplication and
boilerplate code in the v4l2 drivers.

This series tries to address this by moving the DRM format API into lib and
turning it into a more generic API. In order to do this, we've needed to do
some preliminary changes on the DRM drivers, then moved the API and finally
converted a v4l2 driver to give an example of how such library could be
used.

Let me know what you think,
Maxime
