drm/sun4i: Add A83t LVDS support

Hi,

Here is an attempt at supporting the LVDS output in our DRM driver. This
has been tested on the A83T (with DE2), but since everything is basically
in the TCON, it should also be usable on the older SoCs with minor
modifications.

This was the occasion to refactor a bunch of things. The most notable ones
would be the documentation, and split of the UI layers in the mixer code,
and the switch to kfifo for our endpoint parsing code in the driver that
fixes an issue introduced by the switch to BFS.

Let me know what you think,
Maxime
